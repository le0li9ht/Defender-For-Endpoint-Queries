CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog serves as a crucial resource for organizations, aiding in the prioritization of vulnerability management. By addressing the vulnerabilities listed in the catalog, organizations can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture and protect against potential exploits.

#### KQL Query
Below query extract data from CISA's known vulnerabilities database and cross-reference it with the organization's vulnerability records, generating a prioritized list of vulnerabilities for remediation.
```
//https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
let Vulners = externaldata(cveID: string, vendorProject: string, product: string, vulnerabilityName: string, dateAdded: string, shortDescription: string, requiredAction: string, dueDate:string, KnownRansomwareCampaignUse: string, notes: string)[@'https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/csv/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.csv'] with (ignoreFirstRecord=true);
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| join kind=inner(Vulners) on $left.CveId==$right.cveID
| project DeviceName, OSPlatform, OSVersion, OSArchitecture, SoftwareName, SoftwareVersion, CveId, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel, RecommendedSecurityUpdate, RecommendedSecurityUpdateId, CveMitigationStatus, KnownRansomwareCampaignUse

```
